# Ultrasonic Distance Measurement with HC-SR04

## Overview

In the realm of non-contact distance measurement, various methodologies with distinct advantages and limitations have been developed. Microwave or laser-based systems provide extensive measurement capabilities at the expense of reduced resolution, whereas optical and infrared sensors offer high resolution but limited measurement ranges. However, ultrasonic sensors have proven to be an especially dependable and affordable option.

Ultrasonic Sensors, such as the HC-SR04 model, are crucial for measuring distances and detecting objects. These sensors consist of key parts that work together seamlessly. The transmitter sends out ultrasonic waves, the receiver captures echoes from objects, and the control circuit manages important functions like timing and noise filtering. The sensor includes four essential pins: VCC for power, TRIG for triggering, ECHO for receiving echoes, and GND for grounding.

## Working Principle

The basic idea is simple: the sensor sends out sound waves, which bounce back when they hit something. By measuring how long it takes for the echoes to return, the sensor can accurately calculate the distance. The HC-SR04 model, in particular, requires a trigger pulse to start emitting 40 kHz ultrasound.

## Applications

These sensors find wide use in robotics, automation, and various industries due to their precision and versatility. This report examines the fundamental concepts and various applications of ultrasonic sensors in non-contact distance measurement.
